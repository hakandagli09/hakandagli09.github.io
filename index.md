- **Prophet + XGBoost Pipeline:** Leveraged Prophet for seasonality/holiday effects, extracted its components, and used XGBoost for enhanced predictive power.  
- **Feature Engineering & Modeling:** Incorporated holiday data, price information, and Prophet’s trend/seasonality features into XGBoost for improved forecasts.
- **Results & Visualization:** Evaluated with MAE/RMSE/MAPE, then plotted historical vs. predicted values to illustrate performance and future forecasts.

This project explores **K-Fold Cross-Validation** and **Lasso Regression** for predictive modeling. 
It includes:
- Implementing **K-Fold Cross-Validation** to improve model robustness
- Using **Lasso Regression** for feature selection and regularization
- Evaluating model performance with **RMSE and R² scores**
